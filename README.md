# Multiclass-classificaftion-with-high-dimensional-data
In this project I aimed to classify 9 classes with the purpose of minimizing log-loss metric. Dataset contains 103 features with 9 classes. After I preprocessed the data, I tried to apply deep learning algorithms and random forest method. The accuracy was nearly 83%; however the log-loss metric did not decrease below 45% in the results of the test set.
